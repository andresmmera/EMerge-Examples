Run 1:  Wed Jul 02 05:53:18 2025.  SL685a1842.
        Em version 18.53-Lite (64-bit Windows) on andres-k55vd local.

  Project:  Z:\home\andresmmera\.qucs\T_Junction_prj\T_Junction.son.

    Begin electromagnetic simulation using independent parameters:
      W_50 = 1.13 mm
      L0 = 45 mm
      W_100 = 0.272 mm
      L1 = 47.3 mm

    Begin electromagnetic simulation using frequency sweep:
      ABS Start = 0.1, Stop = 5 GHZ

    Frequency:  0.1 GHZ

      Sonnet Warning:
      Adaptive band synthesis.
      Primary structure has potential box resonances.
      ABS may require large number of discrete frequencies for convergence.


    Frequency:  2.7 GHZ

      Sonnet Warning:
      Potential de-embedding problem.
      Unable to determine Z0 and Eeff for
      left box wall standard at 2.7 GHz.
      De-embedded s-parameters may not be valid.


    Frequency:  4.68 GHZ
